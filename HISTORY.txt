===========================
Minor bugfixes & Enhancements
-----------------------------
o Included and updated a 'Help System' which works via topics stored in WoPs MySQL database
  and displays help topics depending on the current screen. Help system can be managed in
  the 'Admin Panel'. Make sure you import the 'help.sql' file from the includes folder in to
  your WoP MySQL database. You will see the word 'HELP' with a pic of a brain on the top, left
  hand side of the screen.
  (header.php, menu.php, admin/index.php, styles/phaos.css, images/help.gif, admin_help_*.php & help_*.php files).
  
o Deleted some redundant files that were floating about.
  (ims[renamed], race-specials.txt[renamed], home.php, header.phpOLD, HELP[folder],
  admin\admin_specials_Check_Specials.php, admin\images\admin_specials_Check_Specials.gif, admin\phaos.css,
  admin\images\admin_edit_Opps.gif)
  
o Created new Admin Panel option to Edit the Characters that are currently in the game world.
  Makes things easier if you want to place a newly created Monster/Opponent into the game or
  just edit the stats of one all ready in the game. This will also display all player characters
  in the game world too. Still needs some fine tuning though to edit some in game characters details.
  (admin\admin_edit_World_Characters.php, admin\change_wrldchr.php).
  
o Updated:
	- all Admin Panel files <title> changed, changed layout to the main phaos.css file (Old admin one deleted)
	- Admin Panel now displays option to Optimize your WoP SQL Database
	  ('admin_sql_Optimize_Database.php' renamed to 'admin_options_Optimize_Database.php', .GIF image also changed)
	- Arena and Character screens layout with buttons to show links. (arena.php, character.php)
	- text that shows your item counts in shops(darksmith.php, shop.php, magic_shop.php, lang\en.php)
	- layout of Item Shop, so it looks more like Magic Shop layout (shop.php)
	- available points now only increase a stat by 1 instead of 5(class_character.php)
	
o FIXED:
	- Admin Panel now correctly shows who is currently online (admin/admin_options_Whos_Online.php)
